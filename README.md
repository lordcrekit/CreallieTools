# JEasy
When working with java I found some of the stuff was ancient code and sometimes didn't work. This project intends to provide replacements.

# What it does

* Better properties class. The existing one is ancient and has weird save/load behaviour that was unreliable and different on different machines.
* Some file utilities (delete directory, etc)
* Some keygen stuff. For ID's and stuff, not security credentials.
